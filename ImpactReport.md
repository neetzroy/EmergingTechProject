## Introduction
This impact report will be evaluating the features, functions and impacts of the proposed Emerging technologies and practices to RegenTech from the Skynet Research team.

The selected emerging practices for RegenTech are mentioned as below:

- Drone Technology: Drones
- IoT: Soil Sensors
- Robotics: Robots
## Features and Functions

**Drone Technology: Drones**

The drones used in the agriculture land will be aerial drones, which will have fixed wings, a rotor, and a remote control.  These Drones has the capability to attach cam recorder with memory chip with it. This memory chip embedded in the drone can be used to store the image and video data. This information will be later used for making interactive visuals with the help of augmented reality to make it easily and affordably available to the clients. 

**IoT: Soil Sensors**

Soil Sensors installed throughout in the farmlands can communicate and transmit data each other and operate according to the information recorded without human intervention. Here the soil sensors will be sensing the moisture levels and fertilizer levels and perform actions according set rules or programs loaded in the device

**Robotics: Robots**

The robots that are being introduced in the farmlands are specifically for recording weather measurements, taking soil samples and measure crops. The data collected by the robots will be send to the RegenTech HQ to analyse and obtain the statistics data based on the collected information. This will be faster, meaningful, and more interactive to the receiving clients.
## Impact Analysis

### Cost of Acquisition
Introducing new emerging technologies like drones, soil sensors and robots in the farmlands is going to need some initial investment. Drones and soil sensors are now becoming more affordable and hence the cost spend will be returned within few months in terms of increased productivity. But the implementation of robots will need a significant amount of investment for its programming and operations. But a lot of government schemes are available to support and encourage our local farmers to come forward with new technologies. Also, a few of the farmers have to be trained in the basics of operating robots and its programs, all those costs can be covered with government subsidies.
### Cost of Removal
The cost of removal of drones and soil sensors are very little significant in terms of the returns from the farms as a result of increased productivity within short period of time. But the cost of removal of robots will be a significant factor as the robots are integrated with Artificial Intelligence and the farmers are also trained in the field. 
### Differentiating Factors
The agriculture field is getting competitive day by day. If the farmers are not adapting to the new emerging technologies, they will have to face a very slow growth in their income and productivity when compared to other highly adaptive competitors which will affect their whole system and profit margins. 
### Legal and Regulatory Responsibilities.
Drones on farmlands can be a threat to military related operations and security. Also, Unmanned robots can be a threat to both people and farm related properties. So, the approvals from the government bodies can be a difficult task.
