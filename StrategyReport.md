## Introduction
This strategy report discuss about the organisational response to the emerging technologies and practices proposed by Skynet Research team to RegenTech as a replacing solution to the current technologies at RegenTech to have better and efficient results to their clients from agriculture.
## Strategy Report
The list of emerging technologies and practices that are going to implement in different departments of RegenTech are mentioned below:

- Drone Technology for Planning Department.
- IoT-Soil sensors for Automation Department.
- Robotics for Decision Support Department.
## Strategic Analysis

1. ### Potential threats, opportunities, and changes with emerging technology practices at RegenTech.
There is a potential threat of losing clients and projects and less profit margins if RegenTech continues to use the current practices which are very expensive and slow to reach the clients with meaningful reports and on time services.

But there are also some chances of potential threats and changes could happen when applying new emerging technology at a place, but it’s the long-term opportunities are more focussed here.

As we talk about threats, for e.g., Drone technology, drones can be misused in many ways and its always a threat to military and security agencies. Drones are never allowed near Airports, so if any farmlands are located near airports, then we cannot implement drones for such clients.

Same can be happened with Robotics also as robots are unmanned machines with artificial intelligence. Any technical glitch or even a minute programming error can cause human loss or property loss.

Here, we are focussing more on the opportunities that can be benefitted from it by RegenTech. Apart from the threats possessed by these emerging technologies, we when we calculate the long-term benefits with controlled usage of these technologies are beyond the expected range. Introducing these practices will help to replace the currently expensive practices and make it faster to prepare visualisation guides for the clients, also this will completely solve the time delays in services to clients. This will be a great addition to the decision support team to speed up their jobs to make it easily available to the clients.


1. ### How the emerging technologies and practices relate to RegenTech organisational goals.
The organisational goal is to obtain optimal results with the new emerging technologies being introduced in the company within the 5 years. 

All the emerging practices mentioned here are related and tailored to the requirements of RegenTech with reducing costs, reducing time delays, producing meaningful reports to the clients on time, making easily understandable and visual contents to the clients and maximum results with automating and adapting the current systems.
1. ### Changes and steps to help achieve the goals
The first step will be making changes to the existing system and going for several trails with the new technologies to evaluate its success and durability to avoid any future loss.

If at any point, any of these emerging practices is found to be unsuitable, a review will be completed to analyse the reasons for failure, so RegenTech would be able to monitor the ongoing trial results and feedback system of all these practices to reconsider it and try again at in the future when the failure points are addressed.

After the trials, the RegenTech will be analysing the feedback from employees and clients to make the further improvements and changes to make it for more sustainability in the future. Also, the trail results and feedback always helps to maintain the standards with the organisational goals.
## Summary & Conclusion
As a result of thorough analysis and studies based on several aspects such as impact analysis, trial results, ruling out of possible failures and feedbacks from the clients on these new emerging technologies, it is evident that these practices fits with wider organisational goals and there will not be any major negative aspects that affect the overall system of RegenTech with adopting the new proposed technologies.
